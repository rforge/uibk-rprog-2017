Description: Build a tree fitting a distributional model in each node.
  As a framework the MOB algorithm is used to build the tree and a distribution is specified by handing over a gamlss.family object.
  In each node of the tree a distributional model is fit via maximum likelihood and the resulting scores are used to find splits. 
  For each terminal node a set of distribution parameters is provided.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.0), partykit (>= 1.2-0), gamlss.dist
