Description: The treatment effect is estimated by applying nearest neighbours matching (NN) and difference in differences (DD). Nearest neighbours are matched by applying a GLM over an individual time span. In the following a liner model is estimated with a difference in differences setup. Each estimation (NN or DD) can depend on different covariates. Simple evaluation methods of the combined estimation are provided.
